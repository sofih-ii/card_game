Card Game Implementation
Imagine you're building a simple card game. You have an array representing a deck of cards, and you want to perform the following operations:

Shuffle the Deck: Randomly rearrange the order of the cards in the deck.
Deal Cards: Deal a specific number of cards to players from the top of the deck.
This exercise involves using the splice() method to shuffle the deck and deal cards.
